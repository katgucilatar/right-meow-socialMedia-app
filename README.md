## Description
Right Meow was created for an assignment by UNC Coding Bootcamp. This app utilizes Express and Mongoose to create a database in which users can be added, deleted and their thoughts can be added and deleted as well as adding reactions; this app also utilizes DayJS to show a timestamp in which these are created.

Watch the following walkthrough video to see how this app works:

## Installation
In order to download this code from the repository, one must have a software such as VS Code or one that's similar. Along with VS Code, it is necessary to download Node.JS.

After downloading Node.JS, it is important to install the packages associated with this app in order to be able to access its full properties.

Before opening this app in VS Code, make sure to Git Clone this project otherwise all packages will have to be installed manually.

Begin by opening the terminal, and typing in "npm init -y" as this will set a basic package.json file. 

Now we can install everything by typing "npm install" and it will install the packages that have been installed into this app.

Lastly before we test this app, we can run "node server.js" or "npm start" in the terminal to connect to the server.

## Tests
Upon installing everything, this app is tested using Insomnia. There are users and thoughts and for each of those are a GET request obtaining all data information from each of those sections, a GET request obtaining single data information using its ID, a POST request to create a user or thought to the database, a PUT request to update any information on the database, and a DELETE request to delete a user or thought on the database. Friends and reactions also have the option to run POST requests to add a new friends or add a new reaction as well as DELETE requests to delete them.
